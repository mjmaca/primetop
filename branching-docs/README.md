## BRANCHING STANDARD NAMES

if creating for a new feature, please create a branch based on `master` branch.
create the name of your branch as `feature/{name of the feature}`
feature name could be anything as long as you think it describes how it works.

example:
`feature/profile-management`
`feature/ai-scheduling-system`
`feature/sorting-cats-and-dogs`

if creating a branch for bug issues: `bug/{name of the bug}`
if just cleaning the code because why not? you can use: `chores/{name of the chore}`

## SUMMARY
- `feature/{name of the feature}`
- `bug/{name of the bug}`
- `chores/{name of the chore}`

### NOTE: NEVER PUSH TO MASTER BRANCH ALWAYS CREATE SEPERATE BRANCH TO MERGE.

Thank you!
